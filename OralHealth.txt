Name: PATHOLOGY & RADIOLOGY OF DENTO -OSSEOUS ANOMALIES II  
Description: The course is an examination course presented  over one year.  The theory will 
be presented by the Unit of Oral Pathology with clinical discussions and sessions 
in support of the bony pathology done in unit of Radiology.  The clinical 
applications of radiography completed during BDS 2 and BDS 3 remain  
examinable in BDS 4:  
 Pathology and Radiology of Abnormalities of the Dentition  
 Pathology and Radiology of Odontogenic Tumours and Cysts  
 Diseases of Bone  
 Forensic Odontology   
 153 Learning Outcomes  The course is aimed to provide both theoretical aspects of hard  tissue pathology 
of the head and neck supported by practical interpretation thereof in the clinical 
setting.  The content teaches students to interpret and differentiate normal and 
pathologic structures on radiographs of the head and neck as performed in 
clinical dental practice.  The course in hard tissue pathology serves as the basis 
for clinical surgical subjects who will manage/treat the diseases.  
The course will also provide the student with a sound basis in Forensic 
Odontology to enable the qualified  dentist to support police investigations when 
requested to do so.

Description: Introduction:  The module is stratified into units which cover the theoretical and 
practical aspects of complete denture prostho dontics. Practical exercises 
involving the laboratory fabrication of various prostheses are a requirement and 
students will be required to complete these to a satisfactory level.  
Course Purpose Statement:  At the end of this course students will have gaine d 
the necessary psychomotor and cognitive skills to fabricate complete dentures 
including  knowledge of the oral anatomy of the edentulous mouth, associated 
dental materials used in the laboratory procedures and techniques required to 
fabricate complete de ntures.  
Learning Outcomes  By the end of this module, students will have the cognitive and psychomotor 
skills to be able to:   
 166 1. Demonstrate knowledge of the anatomy of the edentulous mouth and how it 
relates to complete denture prosthodontics  
2. Carry out techni cal exercises to construct various complete denture 
laboratory procedures viz a viz with Class I; Class 2 and Class 3 skeletal 
and dental relationships  
3. Describe the factors to be taken into account to create a balanced 
articulation for Angle Class I, II an d III jaw relationships

Assessment Criteria  The minimum technical criteria must be fulfilled. Students will be assessed on 
their psychomotor skills on the basis of their ability to complete all procedures 
associated with the construction and refinement of complete dent ures (including 
the associated dental materials) to an acceptable technical standard. They will 
also be assessed on their cognitive skills on the ability to identify and understand 
the associated problems and errors that may occur with complete denture 
prosthodontics.  
Assessment Methods  The University rules informing formative/continuous and summative/end of year 
assessment prevail (Rule G12 -20). Assessment can include any topic previously 
covered as the subject should be seen as a continuum of continuous ly acquired 
knowledge building on from previous modules and at times modifying knowledge 
previously learnt, and not as discreet pockets of knowledge. Continuous 
assessment of knowledge will be the cornerstone of the assessment 
requirements.  
Students will b e assessed through various methods, including but not limited to:  
1. Written tests

 168 Assessment Criteria  The minimum technical/clinical criteria must be fulfilled in the time given by 
performing the required clinical/technical procedures to an acceptable quality. 
Students will be asses sed on their cognitive and psychomotor skills on the basis of 
their ability to complete all procedures associated with the construction and 
refinement of removable prostheses (including the associated dental materials) to 
an acceptable technical and clinic al standard and the identification and 
understanding of any associated problems and errors that may occur with 
removable prostheses.  
Assessment Methods  The University rules informing formative/continuous and summative/end of year 
assessment prevail (Rule G12-20). Assessment can include any topic previously 
covered as the subject should be seen as a continuum of continuously acquired 
knowledge building on from previous modules and at times modifying knowledge 
previously learnt, and not as discreet pockets o f knowledge. Continuous 
assessment of knowledge will be the cornerstone of the assessment requirements.  
Students will be assessed through various methods, including but not limited to:  
 Written tests  
 Clinical/technical tests
