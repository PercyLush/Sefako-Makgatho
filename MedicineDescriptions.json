Applications in Microbiology will be illustrated by \nspecific examples i.e. bioremediation, animal -microbial symbiosis, plant -microbial symbiosis and the use of \nmicroorganisms in industrial microbiology. Wastewater treatment, mic robial diseases and food will be introduced \nusing specific examples.  \n \nWhile Genetics will be covered include chromosomes and cell division. Principles of Mendelian inheritance: locus \nand alleles, dominance interactions and epistasis. Probability studies, s ex determination and sex linked traits, \npedigree analysis, extra nuclear inheritance, genetic linkage, chromosome mapping and chromosome variation will also be covered. Basic human reproductive organs aspects will include reproductive health and human \nwelfare, implantation and placental physiology in pregnancy, placental secretions and their regulation.  Basic \nunderstanding of diabetes pathophysiology, diabetes biology, diabetes prevention and diabetes therapy will be covered. Discussion about various psycho social aspects of type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be done.  \n \nMoreover, understanding of relationships between different organisms to one another and to their physical surroundings will be covered under Ecology. Environmental science that will be covered inc lude public awareness \nof environment issues, role of Government, NGO\u2019s, environmental movements, natural resources, effect of human activities, depletion of resources, generation of waste, threats to biodiversity, extinction of species and sustainable \ndeve lopment.  Understand the scientific study of the physiology, structure, distribution, classification, and \nimportance of plants will also be covered.  \n \nLastly, this module will cover process of science which consists of scientific method where by the collect ion of \ndata through observation and experimentation, and the formulation and testing of hypotheses will be done.  \n The teaching program comprises of one formal lecture per week (40 minutes) and one tutorial session (80 \nminutes) and 2 hour practical session  a week.",
