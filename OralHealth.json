Students \nwill be required to complete a minimum number of clinical and technical procedures \nin removable and fixed prosthodontics respectively.  \nCourse Purpose Statement:  At the end of this module students  will have gained the  \n 169 necessary psychomotor, cognitive and affective skills to undertake clinical practice \nin the field of removable prosthodontics and the techniques associated with the \npractice of fixed prosthodontics, including  knowledge of the associa ted dental \nmaterials used in both laboratory and clinical procedures required in prosthodontics.  \nLearning Outcomes  By the end of this module, students will have the cognitive, affective  and \npsychomotor skills to be able to:  \n\uf0b7 Critically evaluate the influe nce of complete and partial dentures on the \nremaining soft tissues and the underlying bony support  \n\uf0b7 Understand the scope and limitations of complete and partial dentures together \nwith the biocompatibility and physical properties of the materials used their \nconstruction  \n\uf0b7 Understand the socio -economic consequences of tooth loss and replacement, \nthe role of a complete and partial denture service for communities served and in \nrelation to a national oral health policy within a national health service  \n\uf0b7 Develop a bio logic rationale for the restoration of occlusal function and harmony \nin dentate patients and how various types of articulators assist in this process  \n\uf0b7 Perform the technical/practical procedures involved in production of various cast \nrestorations  \nModule Inf ormation:  SAQA Credits   ITS Course Level Code  CESM Code (3rd Order)  \n36 3 090312  \nDelivery Information:  Campus  Full/Part Time  Period \n(Year/1st/2ndSem)  \nSMU  FT Y \nPeriods per week:  36  Weeks  Classes  Clinicals  Tutorial  Seminars  Independent \nLearning  \n2X40 MIN 7 X 1 HR",

The \nminimum clinical/technical criteria must be fulfilled in the time given by performing \nthe required clinical/technical procedures to an acceptable quality. Stude nts will be \nassessed on their cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills on the basis of their \nability to complete all procedures associated with the construction and refinement of \nremovable prostheses (including the associated dental materials) to an acc eptable \ntechnical/clinical standard and the identification and understanding of any \nassociated problems and errors that may occur with removable prosthodontics. \nStudents will also be assessed on their cognitive and psychomotor skills on the \nbasis of their ability to complete all the requirements of the fixed prosthodontics \ncourse to an acceptable level.  \nAssessment Methods  The University rules informing formative/continuous and summative/end of year \nassessment prevail (Rule G12 -20). Assessment can include a ny topic previously \ncovered as the subject should be seen as a continuum of continuously acquired \nknowledge building on from previous modules and at times modifying knowledge \npreviously learnt, and not as discreet pockets of knowledge. Continuous \nassessmen t of knowledge will be the cornerstone of the assessment requirements.  \nStudents will be assessed through various methods, including but not limited to:  \n\uf0b7 Written tests  \n\uf0b7 clinical tests  \n\uf0b7 Assignments  \n\uf0b7 Reflection reports/journals  \n\uf0b7 Written clinical topics tests (OSCE )  \n 170   Mark",
